## LetsVenture's OTP verification using Twillio 

One of the LetsVenture's Sign up page stage requires OTP verification from the user (investor/founder). Since we know that the OTP is sent to users mobile number and we cannot fetch OTP from mobile phones using Cypress automation tool.

So this where the Twillio can be used for automating OTP verification.

If we take any website the OTP verification is customary. The OTP is sent to users mobile number which can be in any remote area/place and then user types in the recieved OTP in the website. So how Twilio help us in automating this process ?

When we sign up in Twillio, Twillio will issue a randomly generated mobile number with +1 extension and when we log into our account the apllication will act as a mobile phone. If we receive any message to our newly generated mobile number then the message will be reflected in the twillio dashboard.


## Implementation

- First create an account on Twillio by visiting this page = https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio

- Once you create your account, go to the home page

- You will be able to view your account details and trails amount of $14 shown in the above image which will decrease after usage.

- You can also view the account info like account SID, auth token and Twillio number as shown below.

### Integrating Twillio with Cypress for automating OTP verification

- Open Cypress in Visual studio

- Create a json file and name as a you wish (cred.json)

- And copy Account SID, Auth token and twillio url from Twillio dashboard as shown below:

- And past it in cred.json file

- Now go to the script where the OTP needs to be verified, and add your twillio mobile number.

- And add request message with credentials in the code as shown below

After writting code, you have to run the script and the magic happens, the OTP verification happens automatically.

- Once the OTP is generated by LV's application, the OTP will be sent to the twillio number which is mentioned in the code and the OTP can be viewed in the Twillio's dashboard as shown in below picture:

Here our code will fetech the recent OTP from Twillio and paste it into the OTP field while Cypress test run.
